                        Sagas Of Mankind is a fascinating evolution-strategy
                        game in which players lead their civilization through
                        centuries of evolution and adapt to a changing
                        environment. When starting the game, players begin their
                        adventure as a primitive community that must survive in
                        a wild world. The game offers many different strategies
                        that players can use to achieve success - from trade and
                        diplomacy to territorial expansion and war. However,
                        what makes this game stand out is its advanced and
                        unique time managment system. Players will have to adapt
                        their civilization to the changing environment, as well
                        as to competitors. The game offers an engaging
                        single-player campaign, as well as a multiplayer mode,
                        where players can compete with other players from around
                        the world. All this is set in beautiful, dynamic
                        graphics that attract attention and provide a great
                        visual experience.
